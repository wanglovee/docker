My device is raspberry pi 4b. I found that using apt-get install samba version is not the latest, so I want to install the latest version of samba. At the beginning, I went to the official website to download the latest version, but I couldn't install it from the source code. Finally, I found that samba can be run in docker.
OK, let's get started.
