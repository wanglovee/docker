Run the samba service in docker
My equitment is raspberry pi 4b.I found use apt-get install samba version wasn't the newest,so i want to install the latest version of samba.At the beginning，I went to the official website download the latest version,but i can't  install it by source code.Finally，I run samba in docker.

OK,let's get start.
